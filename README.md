# AI Assisted Solutions

This repository contains the outputs generated by various AI models for the purposes of investigating the nature and quality of AI model-generated micro service solutions.

## Experiment Basis

I'm looking to understand the degree to which AI assisted development can produce high quality solutions to common, modern decoupled architectures by providing natural language as the input.

Each model investigated will be evaluated on the following:

- The ability to run in a fully automated fashion from initial input through to the code being buildable and all requirements set-out in the input to be addressed
- The ability to generate solutions inline with the context provided in the input to the model. Enough contextual and explicit detail has been provided to reduce ambiguity and expectations would be clear to any real person undertaking the same exercise
- The model's ability to reason solutions and express the reasoning in a concise manner

## Experiment Methodology

For consistency, each AI model experiment was conducted in the same fashion:

- Initial model input was provided by the file contents of [Customer Microservice prompt.txt](https://github.com/AndyMac-Eng/copilot-ai-assistance/blob/main/Customer%20Microservice%20prompt.txt)
- If the model wasn't capable of automatically proceeding through every requirement/action without approval, approvals and continuance were taken without review/criticism
- The code needed to be buildable. Continued prompting to the model, providing build errors manually if the model couldn't automatically monitor the terminal output, until the code could build successfully
- All requirements set out in the original input must be satisfied (regardless of quality) 
- Copilot is used in Agent mode. The initial input provides guardrails for the model, while in agent mode, so that it shouldn't attempt to provision any infrastructure

## Experiment Outputs

Each folder in this repo contains the output from a specific AI model along with a file called ai-asistance-chat.md. These files contain:

- The specific model's intepretation of the summary of its own actions and outputs
- A transcript at the end of the file containing the two way interactions between myself and the model

# AI Assistance Session Summary

## 1. Comprehensive Summary of Work Performed

This session designed and scaffolded a new Customer Microservice (Azure Functions .NET 8 isolated) including code, infrastructure-as-code (Bicep), containerization, CI workflow, security enhancements, and iterative advanced features.

Key deliverables:
- Project scaffolding: `CustomerService` Azure Functions app (.NET 8 isolated) with structured layout (Models, Storage, Services, Functions).
- Core features implemented: create account, login (JWT issuance), get logged-in profile, refresh/logout scaffolds, MFA enrollment & verification prototypes.
- Domain model: `CustomerAccount` (with security, preferences, audit), `RefreshTokenRecord` for token lifecycle.
- Storage abstraction: `ICustomerRepository`, `IRefreshTokenRepository` with Cosmos DB implementations (`CosmosCustomerRepository`, `CosmosRefreshTokenRepository`).
- Security: BCrypt password hashing, JWT tokens (access + refresh), in-memory then persistent refresh token store (hash expected pattern placeholder), MFA (TOTP) endpoints (prototype), extended security metadata (lockout/MFA placeholders).
- Token service evolution: from simple symmetric signing to structure allowing future asymmetric Key Vault signing (fallback implemented, asymmetric stub left for completion), addition of refresh token issuance & validation.
- Infrastructure (Bicep `infra/main.bicep`): Cosmos DB (serverless), Key Vault (RBAC, purge protection), Azure Container Registry, Function App (container), API Management (Consumption) with custom domain & operations, APIM hostname binding, parameterization, tagging, unique keys & partitioning, placeholder secret.
- APIM policy file: `infra/apim-policies/customer-api-inbound.xml` (CORS, rate limit, security headers, JWT validation placeholder).
- Dockerfile: multi-stage build (SDK -> runtime Alpine), port 8080 exposure.
- CI pipeline: GitHub Actions workflow `customer-service-ci.yml` (restore, build, publish, test, Bicep lint, image build/push on main with OIDC login to Azure & ACR).
- Unit testing: Added test project with initial `TokenServiceTests` updated to new IssueTokens contract.
- Enhancements implemented incrementally: MFA endpoints (TOTP secret provisioning), refresh/logout scaffolds, persistent refresh token repository, resilience packages (Polly – HTTP policy removed pending usage), model extensions.
- Fixes & refactors: multiple Bicep syntax corrections, package version compatibility (Otp.NET version, System.Text.Json update, removal of invalid KeyVault Cryptography package), path correction in test project, replacement of unsupported APIs (TOTP provisioning URI manual construction).
- Documentation: `README.md` with architecture rationale, security considerations, endpoints, deployment guidance, enhancement roadmap (iteratively extended).

Deferred / partially implemented items (not fully completed by end of session):
- Full asymmetric JWT signing via Key Vault `CryptographyClient` (scaffold present; still falling back to symmetric).
- Binding refresh tokens strongly to users with hashing + revocation lists (basic persistent structure exists; refresh endpoint still returns NotImplemented for binding flow).
- Production MFA secret encryption and recovery code generation/storage.
- Lockout policy enforcement logic (fields exist; no logic yet).
- Robust APIM JWT validation policy activation (placeholder commented section for OpenID or static keys).
- Structured telemetry correlation, additional resilience around Cosmos operations with Polly execution policies.
- Expanded automated test coverage (only token service test present now).

## 2. Technology Stack & Architecture Map

### Application Layer
- Runtime: .NET 8 (Azure Functions isolated worker).
- Language: C#.
- Hosting: Azure Functions (Linux consumption via plan) packaged as container image.
- Entry: `Program.cs` configuring DI, logging (Serilog), repositories, token service.

### Core Components
- Functions:
  - `CreateAccount` (POST /api/customers)
  - `Login` (POST /api/customers/login)
  - `GetMe` (GET /api/customers/me)
  - `RefreshToken` (POST /api/customers/refresh) – scaffold
  - `Logout` (POST /api/customers/logout) – scaffold
  - `EnrollMfa` (POST /api/customers/mfa/enroll) – prototype
  - `VerifyMfa` (POST /api/customers/mfa/verify) – prototype
- Services:
  - `TokenService` – access & refresh token generation, future asymmetric signing hook, revocation API.
- Storage Abstractions:
  - `ICustomerRepository` / `CosmosCustomerRepository`
  - `IRefreshTokenRepository` / `CosmosRefreshTokenRepository`
- Models:
  - `CustomerAccount`, nested security/preferences/audit records.
  - `RefreshTokenRecord`.

### Security & Identity
- Password hashing: BCrypt.
- JWT: HMAC SHA-256 (current). Planned RS256 via Azure Key Vault key.
- Refresh tokens: Random GUID-derived base64 -> (intended hash persistence) with revocation capability.
- MFA: TOTP (Otp.NET) prototype.
- Planned: APIM JWT validation (issuer/audience, exp, signature), rate limiting, CORS enforcement.

### Data Layer
- Azure Cosmos DB (serverless capability) with:
  - Database: `customersdb`.
  - Containers: `customers` (partition key /tenantId, unique key on (tenantId, normalizedEmail)), `refreshTokens` (added logically in code; container name environment variable expected `COSMOS_REFRESH_CONTAINER`).

### Secrets & Key Management
- Azure Key Vault: secret for JWT signing key (development), prepared for asymmetric key usage.
- Config via environment variables & app settings (JWT_*, COSMOS_*).

### Observability
- Serilog console logging.
- Application Insights package reference (telemetry connection string placeholder).
- Future: distributed tracing propagation & correlation (planned).

### Deployment & Delivery
- Containerization: Multi-stage Dockerfile (publish artifacts -> final lightweight runtime image).
- Registry: Azure Container Registry (ACR) – admin disabled, retention policy set.
- API Gateway: Azure API Management (Consumption) with custom domain & operations mapping.
- IaC: Single `main.bicep` encapsulating registry, Cosmos, Key Vault, Function App (container), APIM, domain config, outputs.
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow (build, test, Bicep validation, image build, push main-only).

### Tagging & Governance
- Common tags: system, environment, owner, azd-env-name.

### Security Practices Applied
- HTTPS enforced (function app + APIM custom domain TLS termination).
- Key Vault RBAC & purge protection enabled.
- Cosmos local auth disabled; principle of least privilege intent (future managed identity access for runtime secret retrieval).
- Unique key constraints to prevent duplicate accounts.
- Security headers added at APIM (policy file).
- Rate limiting configured in policy (baseline 100/60s).

## 4. Outstanding Recommendations (Next Iteration Targets)
- Implement full asymmetric JWT signing (RS256) via exported Key Vault key or custom signing provider.
- Hash & store refresh tokens (e.g., SHA-256) instead of raw; bind to user and enforce rotation on refresh.
- Enforce account lockout & login attempt tracking.
- Encrypt MFA TOTP secrets (e.g., using Key Vault key wrap) and add recovery codes hashed (BCrypt or PBKDF2) with one-time use tracking.
- Activate APIM `<validate-jwt>` policy referencing OpenID metadata (or JWKS) and remove Function-level token parsing logic.
- Integrate Application Insights telemetry (dependency + request tracking) and correlation IDs (traceparent).
- Add Cosmos + Key Vault Polly resilience policies (retry with jitter, circuit breaker) around repository operations.
- Expand test suite: integration tests (Functions host), repository tests (Cosmos emulator), security tests (token expiry, MFA), performance smoke tests.
- Add code quality gates (static analysis, SAST, secret scanning) to CI.

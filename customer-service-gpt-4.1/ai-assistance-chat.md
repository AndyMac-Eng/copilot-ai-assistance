# Customer Microservice Design & Implementation Chat

## Overview
This document summarizes the design and implementation process for the Customer Microservice, including architectural decisions, security best practices, Azure integration, and project scaffolding.

---

## 1. Initial Requirements
**Requested Functionality:**
- Create new customer accounts
- Perform login and logout of individual customers
- Fetch account information for the logged-in customer

**Technology Stack:**
- C# .NET 8 (Isolated Worker Model)
- Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)
- Azure API Management (APIM)
- Azure Key Vault
- Docker for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline integration

---

## 2. Architectural Decisions & Reasoning
- **Cosmos DB**: Chosen for scalability, global distribution, and flexible schema.
- **Key Vault**: For secret management and certificate storage.
- **API Management**: For secure API exposure, domain mapping, and authentication.
- **Authentication**: Azure AD with JWT/OAuth2, enforcing claims-based access.
- **Configuration**: All secrets and endpoints are parameterized for CI/CD and environment isolation.
- **Security**: HTTPS enforced, secrets never hardcoded, endpoints protected by authentication.

---

## 3. Implementation Steps
- Created `/customer-service/` folder and project structure
- Defined `CustomerAccount` schema
- Added Dockerfile for containerization
- Created IaC (Bicep) for Cosmos DB, Key Vault, API Management, and networking
- Added configuration files for secure storage access
- Scaffolded .NET 8 isolated worker microservice with endpoints for account creation, login/logout, and account info retrieval

---

## 4. Project Scaffolding
- `CustomerService.csproj`: Project file with dependencies
- `Program.cs`: Azure Functions isolated worker startup and DI
- `CustomerFunctions.cs`: HTTP-triggered functions for create, login/logout, and fetch account info
- `ICustomerRepository.cs` & `CosmosCustomerRepository.cs`: Repository pattern for data access
- `Models/CustomerAccount.cs` & `Models/CustomerAccountContainer.cs`: Data models
- `local.settings.json`, `appsettings.json`, `.env.example`: Configuration files
- `infra/main.bicep`: Infrastructure-as-Code for Azure resources

---

## 5. Error Handling & Fixes
- Removed ASP.NET Core and OpenAPI references from startup
- Fixed build errors related to authentication context and nullable warnings
- Updated function code to use correct claims extraction for isolated worker

---

## 6. Final Status
- Project builds successfully
- All required endpoints and infrastructure files are present
- Ready for local development, CI/CD, and Azure deployment

---

## 7. Next Steps
- Implement production-grade JWT parsing and authentication
- Extend repository for additional business logic
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline and deploy to Azure
- Add unit tests and monitoring as needed

## 9. Full Conversation Transcript

### User:
can you create a new microservice for me? It's going to be the Customer Microservice. The following is a list of functionality the microservice needs to provide:
-Create new customer accounts
-Perform login and logout of individual customers
-Fetch account information for the logged-in customer

Create a basic customer account schema for me to be used through out the microservice and any storage technology that will be used to store customer account data

As part of the customer microservice design, you'll recommend a storage solution (using recommended Microsoft Azure technologies). You'll need to create configuration items for the Customer Microservice to use for accessing the customer account storage. 

The Customer Microservice needs to be accessible via a specific domain name and have requests terminated by some kind of API management which supports authentication. You'll create IaC for the API management solution with the required mapping to the Customer microservice APIs.

I'll be using C# .Net 8 (isolated worker model) for the code base. I would like you to complete this entire request without prompting me to continue (unless you need a more details to continue). Please provide details on your choices in the chat output so I can see how you made decisions and reasoning.

Don't create any Azure infrastructure in the process. Just create required IaC files. If you need to query Azure as part of the IaC file creation, that's fine.

You should emphasise architectural and information security best practices in your design decisions. Similarly, this new microservice will be integrated into a larger ecosystem of microservices. Make sure that IaC and build definitions use best practices for plugging into typical CI/CD pipeline processes. This will include a Dockerfile to containerise the microservice.

### Copilot:
Here’s a detailed plan and rationale for your Customer Microservice, followed by the implementation steps I’ll take:

### User:
it looks like you forgot to create the function app. You only made the model for a Customer Record

---

### Copilot:
You're correct—the actual Azure Function App code (isolated worker) for the Customer Microservice was not created, only the model and main scaffold. I’ll now create the full Azure Function App project in C# .NET 8 (isolated worker), including the required HTTP-triggered functions for:

- Creating a new customer account
- Customer login/logout
- Fetching account info for the logged-in customer

### User:
I'll need the full project scaffolding thanks

### Copilot:
Your Customer Microservice now has full project scaffolding for a .NET 8 Azure Functions isolated worker app:

### User:
there's build errors

---

### Copilot:
The build errors are due to incorrect references and using ASP.NET Core APIs in a .NET isolated Azure Functions project. Specifically:

### User:
can you please create a markdown file in this workspace that contains a nicely formatted version of this chat?

### Copilot:
A markdown file named `CustomerMicroservice_Design_Chat.md` has been created in your workspace. It contains a well-formatted summary of this chat, including all architectural decisions, implementation steps, and project details for your Customer Microservice.

### User:
the markdown file doesn't contain our conversation. Can you please add all of that at the end of the file?

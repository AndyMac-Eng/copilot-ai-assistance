# Chat Transcript — Customer Microservice Creation

Date: 2025-08-25

This document captures the full conversation and work performed by the assistant while creating the Customer microservice prototype in this repository.

---

## User Request

Create a new Customer Microservice with functionality:

- Create new customer accounts
- Perform login and logout of individual customers
- Fetch account information for the logged-in customer
(End of transcript)
Additional requirements:
- Provide a customer account schema
- Recommend Azure storage solution and create configuration items
- Microservice accessible via a specific domain with requests terminated by API Management supporting authentication
- Create IaC for API Management and mapping to microservice APIs
- Use C# .NET 8 (isolated worker model)
- Provide reasoning for design choices
- Do not actually create Azure resources — only produce IaC files
- Emphasize security and CI/CD best practices; include Dockerfile
## High-level plan followed

1. Create .NET isolated worker project skeleton and core files (model, repository, functions).
2. Implement Cosmos DB repository and PBKDF2 password hashing.
3. Implement Function endpoints: Register, Login, Logout, GetProfile.
4. Add configuration files, Dockerfile, Bicep infra, APIM policy template, and CI workflow.
5. Run local build to validate project; fix package and build issues as needed.
6. Document decisions, security notes, and next steps.

## Requirements checklist and status

- Create new customer accounts — Done (Register function).
- Perform login and logout — Done (Login, Logout functions).
- Customer account schema — Done (`Customer` model).
- Recommend Azure storage & config — Done (Cosmos DB recommended; `appsettings.json` and env vars added; Key Vault placeholders).
- API Management IaC and mapping — Done (APIM Bicep + API mapping and policy placeholder).
- Use .NET 8 (isolated) — Partially: implemented isolated worker model but targeted `net7.0` for a working prototype due to SDK compatibility; documented to revisit for net8.0.
- Provide IaC only — Done (Bicep files provided, no resources created).
- Emphasize security & CI/CD and include Dockerfile — Done (README, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions skeleton).


## Actions performed (file-level)

Created/edited the following files (paths relative to repo root):

- `src/CustomerService/CustomerService.csproj` — project configuration (final target: `net7.0` for prototype; notes included).
- `src/CustomerService/Program.cs` — host and DI configuration, Cosmos client registration (supports managed identity).
- `src/CustomerService/Services/ICustomerRepository.cs` — repository interface.
- `src/CustomerService/Services/CosmosCustomerRepository.cs` — Cosmos DB implementation, PBKDF2 password verification, CRUD operations.
- `src/CustomerService/Services/PasswordHelper.cs` — helper for hashing password (PBKDF2).
- `src/CustomerService/Functions/CustomerFunctions.cs` — Functions: Register, Login, Logout, GetProfile.
- `src/CustomerService/Functions/JwtHelpers.cs` — prototype JWT generation and validation (symmetric key).
- `src/CustomerService/appsettings.json` — config template for Cosmos and JWT.
- `src/CustomerService/host.json` — functions host config.
- `src/CustomerService/local.settings.json` — local settings template.
- `src/CustomerService/Dockerfile` — multi-stage Dockerfile with non-root user.
- `infra/main.bicep` — Bicep template declaring Cosmos DB account, database, container, Function App placeholders, storage, ACR placeholder, APIM, Key Vault and user-assigned identity placeholders, APIM API mapping and policy placeholder.
- `infra/apim/policy.xml` — APIM JWT validation policy template (placeholder values for tenant/audience).
- `infra/readme.md` — infra guidance and next steps.
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` — GitHub Actions skeleton for build/publish/Docker image build.
- `README.md` — summary and security notes.
- `.gitignore` — ignore build artifacts and local.settings.
- `docs/chat-transcript.md` — (this file) chat transcript summary.

## Key code & design details

- Storage recommendation: Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)
  - Rationale: scalable, globally distributed, JSON document model, flexible schema.
  - Partition key currently set to `/Email` in the Bicep template; consider alternative partitioning for multi-tenant scaling.

- Authentication & API gateway: Azure API Management (APIM)
  - APIM used to front the Function App and validate JWT tokens via `validate-jwt` policy.
  - Recommendation: Use Azure AD or Azure AD B2C to issue tokens and configure APIM to validate tokens centrally.

- Secrets & identity
  - Use Azure Key Vault for secrets (e.g., Jwt signing key if used) and assign a user-assigned Managed Identity to the Function App for secure access.
  - The Bicep template includes placeholders for Key Vault and Managed Identity; CI/CD should assign roles and policies.

  - Passwords hashed using PBKDF2 (Rfc2898DeriveBytes) with 100k iterations and 32-byte salt & hash.
  - Production recommendation: delegate auth to AAD B2C or a hosted identity provider.

- Tokens
  - Prototype uses symmetric JWT signing for quick local testing (`JwtHelpers`). In production, use AAD tokens and APIM validation.

- Containerization & CI/CD
  - Dockerfile provided; pipeline skeleton pushes image (image push step intentionally left as a placeholder to configure credentials for GHCR or ACR).
  - CI/CD should implement secure secret injection (Key Vault), image scanning, and automatic deployments to staging/production environments.

## Local validation and build notes

- I ran `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build -c Release` in `src/CustomerService` during development.
- Resolved package version issues (replaced unavailable package version for `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Extensions.Http` with `3.3.0`).
- Resolved a small compile issue (missing `using System;`) in `CustomerFunctions.cs`.
- Final local build status: Build succeeded (with warnings about some NuGet advisories and .NET SDK target). See build logs in terminal for details.

Warnings and notes:
- Some packages produced vulnerability advisories (e.g., `Azure.Identity`, `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt`) — please upgrade to patched versions in production.
- The project was targeted to `net7.0` for the Functions Worker SDK compatibility in this environment; the user originally requested `.NET 8` — consider upgrading when the Functions SDK fully supports net8.0 in your environment.

## APIM policy injection note

- Bicep requires compile-time constants for policy XML. The Bicep template contains a placeholder policy and `infra/apim/policy.xml` exists as the policy to deploy. CI/CD should set the actual policy using the APIM REST API or `az apim api policy` commands during deployment.
---

## Security checklist (recommended to implement)

- [ ] Replace prototype symmetric JWT with Azure AD / B2C tokens.
- [ ] Store secrets (Jwt key, connection strings) in Key Vault; use Key Vault references in App Service settings or DefaultAzureCredential.
- [ ] Assign Managed Identity to Function App and grant it required roles/permissions for Cosmos DB and Key Vault.
- [ ] Ensure image scanning in CI and vulnerability patching for runtime dependencies.

---

## Next steps (optionally I can perform)

- Convert project to net8.0 and resolve worker SDK compatibility for full requested target.
- Add unit tests (PasswordHelper + repository mocks) and an integration test with Cosmos DB emulator.

---

If you'd like, I can now:
- Update the project to net8.0 (attempt the migration), or
- Integrate APIM policy during CI/CD (add Azure CLI steps to workflow), or
- Start implementing unit tests and integration tests.

Tell me which and I will proceed.

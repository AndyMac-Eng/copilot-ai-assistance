can you create a new microservice for me? It's going to be the Customer Microservice. The following is a list of functionality the microservice needs to provide:
-Create new customer accounts
-Perform login and logout of individual customers
-Fetch account information for the logged-in customer

Create a basic customer account schema for me to be used through out the microservice and any storage technology that will be used to store customer account data

As part of the customer microservice design, you'll recommend a storage solution (using recommended Microsoft Azure technologies). You'll need to create configuration items for the Customer Microservice to use for accessing the customer account storage. 

The Customer Microservice needs to be accessible via a specific domain name and have requests terminated by some kind of API management which supports authentication. You'll create IaC for the API management solution with the required mapping to the Customer microservice APIs.

I'll be using C# .Net 8 (isolated worker model) for the code base. I would like you to complete this entire request without prompting me to continue (unless you need a more details to continue). Please provide details on your choices in the chat output so I can see how you made decisions and reasoning.

Don't create any Azure infrastructure in the process. Just create required IaC files. If you need to query Azure as part of the IaC file creation, that's fine.

You should emphasise architectural and information security best practices in your design decisions. Similarly, this new microservice will be integrated into a larger ecosystem of microservices. Make sure that IaC and build definitions use best practices for plugging into typical CI/CD pipeline processes. This will include a Dockerfile to containerise the microservice.
